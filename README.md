# Dwarf Fortress Font Generator

Running examples:

```bash
uv run terminus_12.py
uv run terminus_14_bold.py
uv run ubuntu_14.py
```

`*_nb.py` are [marimo](https://marimo.io) notebooks, so you can open them using marimo:
```bash
uv run marimo edit latin3_terminus_14_bold_nb.py
```
but they still can be used as command line scripts:
```bash
uv run latin3_terminus_14_bold_nb.py
```
